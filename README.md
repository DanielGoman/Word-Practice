# Word-Practice

accessory tool to prepare for the Psychometric Test

A project done back in 2017 when I was studying for the Psychometric Test.

This tool helps students enrich their vocabulary by studying words in Hebrew and in English:

    Hebrew - learn the meaning of words
    
    English - learn their translation to Hebrew
  
### Example of the English studying screen:

As seen in the image above, this software allows the user to deselect the words they're not interested in through the menu.

The 'previous' and 'next' buttons will display only the words which are selected.

The 'hide' button at the buttom deselects the current word.

The 'shuffle' buttom shuffles the order of the words.
